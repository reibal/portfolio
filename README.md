# My Portfolio
As for now, this is a work in progress. It will eventually be a cool portfolio to represent my abilities (or so I hope).

Libraries Used:
 - Tailwind (for styles)
 - Tabler Icons (for all the icons in the site)

Also, if you are reading this, I hope you have a good day! â™¥

## ToDo List
- Include a different icon for each section title (instead of </> for all of them)
- Add technologies used on each project
- Add tags on projects, such as #frontend, #backend, #api, and so on...
- Add an "About Me" section (include soft skills here)
- Show work experience
